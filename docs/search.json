Also cc any group members. Before you submit the assignment check that:\n\n\nAll group members’ names are on the assignment.\nAll tables are numbered and have a caption.\nAll figures are numbered and have a caption and are re-sized to not take up more page space than is necessary to read them.\nNo R syntax is included in the assignment responses document (it should be in your script file!) unless the question specifically asks for the syntax to be included. If there is R syntax included, be sure that it is typeset in a monospaced font (e.g., Courier, Inconsolata)."
